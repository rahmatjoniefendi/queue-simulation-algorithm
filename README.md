# Queue Simulation Algorithm

## Description

  Algorithm implementation of Queue Simulation

## Project Type
- Experiment

## Status
Completed

## Project Type
- Algorithm
- Script
- CLI

## Features
- Can calculate and find values of "ARRIVAL_TIME", "INTO TIME", "FRONT TIME", "QUEUE TIME", "IDLE TIME", "SYSTEM PROCESS TIME" by using "INTER ARRIVAL TIME", "ARRIVAL NUMBER", "SERVICE TIME" values
- Provide comparison between "SERVICE POINT IDLE TIME WITH SIMULATION" and "SERVICE POINT IDLE TIME WITHOUT SIMULATION"
- Transparent calculation process so you can look to all detail about how exactly the algorithm work under the hood

## Tech Stack
- Programming Language
  - Python
